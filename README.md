**A minimal example of using Material UI in a React list app.**

This project is a small demo showing how to build a checklist-style app using [Material UI](https://mui.com/) components within a React application. It serves as a simple example for managing state and UI in a list-based interface.

It is ideal for:
 - Beginners learning React and Material UI basics
 - Developers looking for a lightweight example of state management with lists
 - Anyone who wants a starter template for a checklist or travel packing app
 - The code is intentionally kept simple and readable, without any external state management libraries or complex build tools.
